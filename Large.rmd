#Ours - Australian women who smoke2

y <- data$new_cases
x <- data$female_smokers
z <- data$continent=="Australia"


model_chal <- lm(y ~ x * z)
#Interactive model between female smokers and Australia (being Australian) and 
#total cases/new cases 
summary(model_chal)


#p < 0.01

#EXPLANATION
#As the frequency of Australian women who smoked increased, as did number of new cases. 
#Female smokers alone did not result in a significant value, but Australian women, specifically,
#did. Looks like the women down under need to stop smoking so we can get the pandemic under
#control.

#SUBJECTIVE CONCLUSION
  #Increasing pandemic cases are the result of Australian women not being able to
  #put down the cigarettes. 

#NON-STATISTICAL EXPLANATION
  #Women, who tend to smoke, and are Australian have basically been
  #a major reason for covid cases, if not one of the main (sole)
  #causes for pandemic cases and death.

#CRITIQUE OUR METHODS
  #Obviously, correlation does not equate to causation, and p-values are 
  #only a matter of sample size rather than true significance (at least in life
  #and health sciences)
